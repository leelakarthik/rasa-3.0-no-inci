Like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it requires companies to take certain steps to protect personal information and make available personal information rights to individuals."
  
  utter_diff_ccpa_gdpr:
  - text: "While the CCPA is similar to the GDPR, it is not the same. If you already prepared for the GDPR, you may be able to leverage some of the work that you did to meet your CCPA requirements. Many privacy laws across the world share common themes. These often include:\nConsumer rights to access, update, delete, and receive a copy of personal information\nDifferent obligations based on a company's role as a business or service provider\nTransparency and notice about a company's data practices \nIn contrast to the GDPR, the CCPA also adds the right for consumers to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. Under the CCPA, sale is defined to include any sharing or disclosure for valuable consideration. "

  utter_ccpa_applicable:
  - text: "The CCPA applies to any company that does business in the state of California and satisfies at least one of the following criteria: \n(a) Has annual gross revenues in excess of twenty-five million dollars; \n(b) Buys, receives, sells, or shares, the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices; and \n(c) Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personal information."

  utter_sas_form_enquire:
  - text: In order to keep sensitive data within SAS, please fill out a Sensitive Data Exception Form located at [go/sdmsnow](http://go/sdmsnow). Please choose the radial button for SAS and complete all required fields before hitting submit. Once all levels of approval are complete, we will update the DETECT Preapproval table and your tables will no longer be subject to discovery/quarantine for the timeline allowed. Attached is the risk statement and follow on instructions that should help fulfill your request.

  utter_sas_days_extention:
  - text: Based on current processes and procedures, sensitive data can only be stored within SAS for a max of 180 days due to a lack of proper controls within the SAS domain.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_sol_storing_sd_gt180_days_sas:
  - text: Any requirement to keep sensitive data after the 180 days must result in an alternate approved solution other than SAS

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_executive_approver:
  - text: The Executive Sponsor is whoever the executive to the library owner is. If user is the owner, his/her executive would be the one who needs to approve

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_request_approver_ed:
  - text: Approver should be Executive Director (ED) or above.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_changing_ownership:
  - text: At present, there is no mechanism of re-assigning the table ownership from one user to the other. Among the proposed solutions is the re-assigning of library ownership via "Foster parent" process however it is not currently applicable.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_delete_quarantined_datasets_usage:
  - text: |
        Please use the following command to delete your quarantine datasets. 
        
        %Repeat( %nrstr( %Force_Delete(ME.?) ), DS1 DS2 ...);"
        
        Leave the question mark ? in there. Replace DS1 DS2…. With the names of your datasets without the libname(ME) The dataset names should be separated by space(s).
    
  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_deleting_datasets:
  - text: |
        If the dataset is not quarantined and you wish to delete the entire dataset, you can use the following command in EG.
        
        PROD SQL; 
        DROP TABLE   LibName.TableName ; 
        QUIT;
        
        This will drop the entire table/dataset.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_identifying_owners:
  - text: |
        In SAS Enterprise Guide run the following SQL statement.

        PROC SQL;

          SELECT OFFICIAL_LIB, MEMNAME, OWNER
          FROM SBAPUB.DATASETS
          WHERE
          OFFICIAL_LIB = 'The library name' 
          AND MEMNAME   LIKE '%XXX%'     /* XXX is the dataset full name or part of the name */
        ;
        QUIT;

        If the library name is NOT available, run the following query.

        PROC SQL;

          SELECT OFFICIAL_LIB, MEMNAME, OWNER
          FROM SBAPUB.DATASETS
          WHERE
            MEMNAME   LIKE '%XXX%'         /* XXX is the dataset full name or part of the name */
        ;
        QUIT;

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_sastoshares:
  - text: |
      A shared drive should not be used to replace a SAS table but could be leveraged based off the use case and need. This would be something that would have to be discussed with your risk and compliance partners.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_vulnerabilities_with_sas:
  - text: There are several concerns around sensitive data being stored in SAS, one of them being inadequate access controls as they are not as robust as some of the other platforms within the enterprise.

  utter_sdm_discover_sas_exception_non_member_sensitive_data:
  - text: Sensitive Data is sensitive data regardless of employees or members. Of course our member data poses a higher risk when the proper controls are not implemented. We absolutely cannot make an exception for SSN , but the others are ok to move forward if every attempt has been made to not keep multiple PII elements together in the same table.
