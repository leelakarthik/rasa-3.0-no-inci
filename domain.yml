Like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it requires companies to take certain steps to protect personal information and make available personal information rights to individuals."
  
  utter_diff_ccpa_gdpr:
  - text: "While the CCPA is similar to the GDPR, it is not the same. If you already prepared for the GDPR, you may be able to leverage some of the work that you did to meet your CCPA requirements. Many privacy laws across the world share common themes. These often include:\nConsumer rights to access, update, delete, and receive a copy of personal information\nDifferent obligations based on a company's role as a business or service provider\nTransparency and notice about a company's data practices \nIn contrast to the GDPR, the CCPA also adds the right for consumers to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. Under the CCPA, sale is defined to include any sharing or disclosure for valuable consideration. "

  utter_ccpa_applicable:
  - text: "The CCPA applies to any company that does business in the state of California and satisfies at least one of the following criteria: \n(a) Has annual gross revenues in excess of twenty-five million dollars; \n(b) Buys, receives, sells, or shares, the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices; and \n(c) Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personal information."

  utter_timeline_ccpa:
  - text: "The CCPA becomes operative on January 1, 2020, but the California Attorney General will not bring enforcement actions until July 1, 2020."
